// Race Day
// You have been hired to write a program that will register runners for a race and give them instructions on race day. All adults will race in the morning and all people under 18 will race in the afternoon. Follow the instructions below to develop the logic for the program!

let raceNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000);
let registerEarly = false;
let age = 100;

if(age > 18 && registerEarly === true)
{
  console.log(`You will race at 9:30 AM and your Race Number is ${raceNumber +=1000}.`);
}
else if (age > 18 && !registerEarly === true)
{
  console.log(`You will race at 11:00 AM and your Race Number is ${raceNumber}.`);
}

else if (age <= 18)
{
  console.log(`You will race at 12:30 PM and your Race Number is ${raceNumber}.`);
}
